# Python Challenges
**My attempt at coding solutions for online python and SQL challenges (Data in Motion, Hackerearth, Hackerrank challenges and others)**

This repository includes some of my code for the weekly python challenges created by Data in Motion. It may also include challenges from other platforms (such as Hackerearth and Hackerrank) as well and will be updated accordingly. You can find all of it [here](https://github.com/V-Mayya/DataInMotion_PythonChallenges/blob/main/challenge_code.py). 

I am open to suggestions and ways to make my code more succinct, so if you have any feedback, please let me know :)
