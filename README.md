# Python Challenges
**My attempt at coding solutions for the data in motion weekly python challenges (and from some other platforms as well)**

This repository includes some of my code for the weekly python challenges created by Data in Motion. It may also include challenges from other platforms as well and will be updated accordingly. You can find all of it [here](https://github.com/V-Mayya/DataInMotion_PythonChallenges/blob/main/challenge_code.py). 

I am open to suggestions and ways to make my code more succinct, so if you have any feedback, please let me know :)
